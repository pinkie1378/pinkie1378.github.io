Senior Consultant & Board Director
Pincus Associates is a family business that specializes in ultraviolet and electron beam curing technology.  I provided support and expertise in a variety of areas:
* R&D of hardcoat formulations for electronic application requiring special optical properties
* Manufacture of UV curable coatings for use in coating, printing, and adhesive applications.
* Market research on capabilities and specifications of UV/EB curing equipment.
* Information technology, computer applications, network and website maintenance.

From 7/2011 thru 10/2011 I contracted my services as an Operations Consultant to Red Rabbit, LLC, a food service company in New York City that provides fresh and healthy school meals.  Red Rabbit expanded from 12 to 45 employees over this period, and my contract was to be the CEO's right hand man and help successfully manage the company during this transition.
* Designed and developed a Salesforce.com based enterprise data system that allowed the company to manage client base expansion from 500 to 5000. This  solution is scalable and designed to manage vast numbers of customers across multiple service sites.
* Developed and implemented a new Information Management System to minimize production errors and improve communication between the client services and operations departments.
* Composed documentation and trained staff for these new systems.
* Oversaw completion of the construction of Red Rabbit's new kitchen and office facility.  Served as a liaison between the architect, the equipment supplier, the landlord, various sub-contractors, and the neighbors.
* Was the principal point of contact for contracted services.
* Managed and maintained Red Rabbit's computer network.
* Categorized company expenses in Quickbooks.
* Composed and edited job listings for positions that needed to be filled as the company expanded.
* Filled in wherever necessary with daily operations to help keep the company running smoothly in a fast paced environment.

University of Massachusetts (3/2008 to 5/2011)
Microbiology, Lovley Lab
Amherst, MA
Postdoctoral Fellow
Worked to develop advanced genetic modification technology, utilizing a selectable/counter-selectable genetic marker and homologous recombination, in the anaerobic microbe Geobacter sulfurreducens (GSU). Also worked to metabolically engineer GSU to fix carbon.
* Exhaustively demonstrated that traditional counter-selection agent 5-fluoroorotic acid/5-fluorouracil doesn't work in GSU.
* Designed a new type of selectable/counter-selectable genetic marker by flanking an antibiotic resistance gene (gentamicin) with a unique nuclease (I-SceI) recognition sequence.
* Experimented with many permutations of plasmids, antibiotic markers, GSU strains, and growth conditions in attempting to optimize the system and make it work reliably.
* Worked with strains of GSU that were resequenced with Illumina/Solexa and 454 next-gen sequencing technologies.
* Found and learned to use Geneious software to manage DNA sequence data and to design new plasmid and primer sequences. Also introduced and taught colleagues to use this program.
* Measured spontaneous mutation rates in wild-type and KN400 electrode strains of GSU.
* Mastered anaerobic culturing techniques. Optimized media preparation procedures to improve batch consistency.
* Repaired and maintained Coy anaerobic chambers.
* Instructed an undergraduate student in anaerobic culturing techniques and molecular biology techniques including PCR, gel electrophoresis, cloning, DNA purification, and bacterial transformation.
* Monthly to bimonthly research updates presented to Dr. Derek Lovley and a large group of colleagues.
* Presented posters at the 2009 American Society for Microbiology general meeting in Philadelphia and the 2008 and 2009 Geobacter conferences at UMass.

Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (9/2001 to 12/2006)
Clinical Research, Simon Lab
Seattle, WA
Research Assistant
Investigated the potential of the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) as a selectively toxic anti-cancer drug target.
* Executed a high-throughput screen for RNR alleles that are synthetically lethal with mismatch repair deletions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
* Performed a battery of experiments to determine the mechanism of this phenotype:
 - Numerous growth phenotype experiments on agar media, utilizing the various yeast strains I generated and media additives.
 - Nucleotide pool composition via HPLC and primer extension assays.
 - Cell cycle profile via FACS analysis.
 - Spontaneous mutation rate measurement and sequence analysis of mutations.
* These experiments showed that the RNR alleles cause the synthetic lethal phenotype by inducing an increased level of genomic instability due to skewed nucleotide pools.
* Collaborated with a structural biology lab, who generated crystal structures of the RNR mutants.
* Made extensive use of yeast genetics, molecular biology, and biochemistry techniques.
* Regularly used Microsoft Office, Endnote, Adobe Photoshop, and ACD Canvas to analyze data, prepare presentations, and write up results.
* Presented oral thesis defense and institute-wide presentations in front of large audiences.
* Quarterly comprehensive research updates presented to Dr. Julian Simon and colleagues.
* Teaching assistant for an introductory biology course and an advanced undergraduate biochemistry lab.
